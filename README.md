## What the project does

This project surveys the capabilities of the Google Play Games API for Android. Specifically, it implements [Real-time Multiplayer Support](https://developers.google.com/games/services/android/realtimeMultiplayer) for a Connect 4 game. This project also implements [achievements](https://developers.google.com/games/services/android/achievements), a [leaderboard](https://developers.google.com/games/services/android/leaderboards) made possible with a [Firebase Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/), and [Google authentication](https://developers.google.com/games/services/android/signin).
